# csl_styles
Repository for Citation Style Language (CSL) citation styles of use to me. 

The main source of included styles is the [open source Citation Style Language (CSL) project](http://citationstyles.org/):
- CSL's [github repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language) which is truncated to 1000 styles
- Extensive databse of many CSL styles in [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/styles) with search facility
